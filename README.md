## **Conclusion**

The internal IT audit at Botium Toys has highlighted several critical gaps in the organization’s cybersecurity posture and compliance practices. These gaps include insufficient access controls, weak password policies, a lack of encryption for sensitive data, and the absence of disaster recovery plans and backups. Additionally, Botium Toys is currently not fully compliant with key standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR, exposing the company to potential data breaches, operational disruptions, and regulatory fines.

To address these issues and support the company’s growing online presence, the following steps are recommended:

Implement robust access control mechanisms, including least privilege and separation of duties.

Strengthen password policies and deploy a centralized password management system.

Install essential security tools like an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and encryption technologies.
Develop and test disaster recovery plans, and establish a regular data backup schedule.

Enhance compliance practices by classifying and inventorying data and providing comprehensive training to employees.

By adopting these measures, Botium Toys can significantly improve its security and compliance posture, reduce risks to critical assets, and foster customer trust. These improvements will not only safeguard the organization against potential threats but also position Botium Toys for sustainable growth in an increasingly competitive online market. The IT department’s proactive steps in implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework will ensure that the company is resilient and well-prepared to handle evolving cybersecurity challenges.
